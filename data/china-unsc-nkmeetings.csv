"China is  opposed to the Security Council discussing the situation  of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of  Korea. The Charter of the United Nations stipulates in  no  uncertain  terms  that  the  primary  responsibility  of   the Security Council is the maintenance of international  peace  and  security.  The  Security  Council  is  not  a   forum  for  discussing  human  rights  issues,  still  less   for the politicization of such issues. Given the current  context,  in  which  international  peace  and  security  are   facing a plethora of dire challenges, the Council should  scrupulously  honour  its  responsibility  and  focus  on   issues related to international peace and security with  undivided attention. China consistently stands for the decnuclearization  of  the  Korean  peninsula  and  insists  that  it  be  kept   peaceful   and   stable   and   that   solutions   be   sought    through dialogue and consultation. We shall not allow  the peninsula to be torn asunder or riven with turmoil  in  any  circumstances.  Our  position  is  in  line  with  the   common   interests   of   the   international   community    and  all  parties,  and  should  be  the  common  goal  of   everyone’s efforts. The  discussion  of  the  situation  of  human  rights   in   the   Democratic   People’s   Republic   of   Korea   is    contrary and detrimental to that goal and of no benefit  whatsoever.  The  current  situation  in  the  peninsula  is   complex, sensitive and dire. China hopes that Council  members and other parties concerned will focus on the  big picture, meet each other half way, do more to ease  tensions  on  the  peninsula,  and  avoid  any  rhetoric  or   action that could provoke or escalate tensions. The  top  priority  for  the  moment  is  to  resume   dialogue and negotiations among the parties as soon as  possible, reopen the Six-Party Talks, jointly safeguard  the  process  of  denuclearizing  the  peninsula  and  make   a  genuine  effort  to  ensure  stability  and  peace  on  the   peninsula. China will push for dialogue and consultation  so  as  to  resolve  the  relevant  issues  on  the  peninsula   within  the  framework  of  the  Six-Party  Talks,  in  order   to  make  a  positive  and  constructive  contribution  to   stability and peace on the peninsula at an early date.",Mr. Liu Jieyi,The situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,7830,2016-12-09
"On 9  September,  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of   Korea conducted yet another nuclear test, in defiance of  the universal objections of the international community.  The  Government  of  China  is  firmly  opposed  to  such   acts.  The  Council’s  adoption  today  of  resolution  2321   (2016)  ref lects  the  international  community’s  united   position  against  the  development  of  nuclear  missile   programmes   by   the   Democratic   People’s   Republic    of  Korea  and  in  support  of  the  international  nuclear   non-proliferation  regime.  The  resolution  reaffirms  the   importance of safeguarding peace and stability on the  Korean  peninsula  and  in  North-East  Asia,  commits   to  seeking  a  solution  to  the  issue  through  peaceful,   diplomatic and political means, supports the resumption  of  the  Six-Party  Talks  and  the  commitments  made  in   the  joint  statement  of  19  September,  and  emphasizes   the importance of easing tensions on the peninsula for  all parties concerned. As the resolution notes, the sanctions measures are  not  aimed  at  worsening  the  humanitarian  situation  in   the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, harming its  people’s livelihoods or affecting normal economic and  trade  activities.  China  urges  the  parties  concerned  to   work to effectively implement the resolution’s relevant  provisions in their entirety. Since the beginning of the  year,  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea  has   conducted  two  nuclear  tests  and  multiple  ballistic- missile    launches.    However,    certain    parties    have     continued  to  strengthen  their  military  deployments,   increase  their  military  presence  and  scale  up  military   exercises,   and   the   confrontation   on   the   peninsula    has  intensified  into  a  vicious  circle  as  a  result.  That   situation must change as soon as possible. As a near neighbour of the Korean peninsula, China  has consistently insisted that it should be denuclearized  and  its  peace  and  stability  upheld.  We  have  always   called  for  the  issue  to  be  resolved  through  dialogue   and  consultations  and  have  fought  against  turmoil   and conflict. We are opposed to the deployment of the  Terminal  High  Altitude  Area  Defense  anti-ballistic   missile   system   on   the   peninsula,   as   it   seriously    undermines the strategic security interests of China and  other countries of the region and disturbs the regional  strategic  balance.  It  is  neither  conducive  to  achieving   the  goal  of  denuclearizing  the  Korean  peninsula  nor   helpful to the maintenance of peace and stability there. China urges the parties concerned to stop forthwith  the  related  deployment  process.  The  current  situation   on the Korean peninsula is sensitive, complex and dire.  All parties must look at the big picture, meet each other  halfway  and  avoid  any  rhetoric  or  action  that  might   exacerbate  tension.  The  top  priority  for  the  parties   concerned  is  to  resume  dialogue  and  negotiations  and   relaunch  the  Six-Party  Talks  as  soon  as  possible  in   order  to  work  together  in  a  genuine  effort  to  advance   the  denuclearization  process  and  achieve  peace  and   stability on the Korean peninsula. China urges the parties concerned to push forward  in parallel the negotiations on denuclearization, on one  hand,  and  the  replacement  of  armistice  with  a  peace   treaty,  on  the  other.  China  will  persist  in  advancing   dialogue  and  consultations  with  a  view  to  solving  the   problems  related  to  the  Korean  peninsula  within  the   framework  of  the  Six-Party  Talks,  thereby  playing  a   positive  and  constructive  role  in  achieving  enduring   peace and stability on the Korean peninsula at an early  date.",Mr. Liu Jieyi,Non-proliferation/Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,7821,2016-11-30
"On   6 January, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, in  defiance of the universal opposition of the international  community,  once  again  conducted  a  nuclear  test,  and   on  7  February  used  ballistic  technology  to  launch  a   satellite in a series of violations of the relevant Security  Council  resolutions.  China  has  expressed  its  explicit   opposition to those actions. China  has  always  insisted  on  the  denuclearization   of  the  Korean  peninsula,  insisted  on  the  maintenance   of  peace  and  stability  on  the  peninsula  and  insisted   on     resolving     problems     through     dialogue     and      consultations.  Resolution  2270  (2016),  adopted  by  the   Council  today,  embodies  the  principles  inherent  in   those  three  “insists”.  The  resolution  demonstrates  the   international   community’s   seriousness   in   opposing    the  further  development  of  the  nuclear  and  missile   capacity of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  and  safeguarding  the  international  non-proliferation   regime  and  reaffirms  the  commitment  to  seeking  a   solution  to  the  nuclear  issue  on  the  Korean  peninsula   through  dialogue  and  consultations  and  to  supporting   the  resumption  of  the  Six-Party  Talks  and  the  Joint   Statement  of  19  September  2005,  thus  facilitating  the   effort to seek a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on  the Korean peninsula. China   has   always   advocated   for   the   peaceful    settlement   of   international   disputes   and   hot-spot    issues  through  political  and  diplomatic  means  such  as   dialogue and negotiations. Sanctions are not an end in  themselves,  and  Security  Council  resolutions  cannot   fundamentally resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula. Today’s resolution should be a new starting  point,  paving  the  way  for  a  political  settlement  of  the   nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. History has demonstrated repeatedly that dialogue  and negotiations represent the only right way to address  the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula if we are to  achieve  an  early  improvement  of  the  situation  on  the   ground  and  explore  viable  ways  to  resolve  the  matter.   China  urges  the  parties  concerned  to  push  forward  in   parallel  the  negotiations  to  advance  denuclearization   and  replace  the  peace  armistice  mechanism  with  a   peace mechanism. While keeping the general direction  of  denuclearization,  this  approach  accommodates  in  a   balanced way the main concerns of the parties involved,  helps find a way towards the resumption of talks and is  practicable.  China  is  willing  to  work  with  the  parties   concerned to explore in depth specific steps to put this  idea into practice and hopes that all parties concerned  will work together to this end. As a close neighbour to the Korean peninsula and a  State that bears an important responsibility for stability  there, China has always insisted on the overall goal of  denuclearization  of  the  peninsula,  opposed  conflicts   and  chaos  in  that  area  and  worked  to  safeguard  the   legitimate security interests of itself and other countries  of the region. At this moment, all the parties concerned  should  avoid  actions  that  will  further  aggravate  the   tensions on the ground. China opposes the deployment  of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile  system on the Korean peninsula because such an action  harms  the  strategic  security  interests  of  China  and   other  countries  of  the  region,  goes  against  the  goal   of  maintaining  peace,  security  and  stability  of  the   peninsula  and  will  seriously  undermine  the  efforts  of   the international community to find a political solution  to the question of the Korean peninsula. Currently, the situation on the Korean peninsula is  highly  complex  and  sensitive,  which  makes  it  all  the   more necessary for us to keep calm and use diplomatic  wisdom.  China  hopes  that  the  parties  concerned  will   meet China half way, always keeping in mind the overall  need to maintain the peace and stability of the Korean  peninsula   and   North-East   Asia,   make   determined    efforts  to  the  dispel  the  dark  cloud  of  war,  pool  our   wisdom   and   actively   seek   common   understanding    and   work   together   for   the   denuclearization   of   the    Korean   peninsula.   China   will   continue   to   take   a    responsible approach to enhancing communication and  coordination  with  the  parties  concerned  and  play  an   active and constructive role for an early realization of  lasting stability and peace on the Korean peninsula.",Mr. Liu Jieyi,Non-proliferation/Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,7638,2016-03-02
"China is  always  opposed  to  intervention  by  the  Council  on   issues  concerning  the  human  rights  situation  in  any   country.  The  Charter  of  the  United  Nations  clearly   lays  out  the  functions  and  division  of  labour  among   the  major  organs  of  the  United  Nations,  which  should   discharge  their  respective  responsibilities  and  refrain   from encroaching on the functions of others.  As   bearer   of   the   primary   responsibility   for    maintaining   international   peace   and   security,   the    Council  should  devote  itself  to  addressing  threats  to   international  peace  and  security.  It  is  not  the  venue   for  addressing  issues  of  human  rights,  and  the  human   rights  situation  in  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic   of  Korea  does  not  constitute  a  threat  to  international   peace  and  security.  China  is  against  allowing  the   Council  to  deliberate  on  the  human  rights  situation  in   the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. We request  that a vote be held on the provisional agenda of today’s  meeting.",Mr. Wang Min ,The situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,7575,2015-12-10
"China   is  opposed  to  exploiting  the  existence  of  large-scale   violations  of  human  rights  in  the  Democratic  People’s   Republic  of  Korea  as  a  reason  to  include  the  situation   in  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea  in  the   agenda  of  the  Security  Council.  The  Charter  of  the   United  Nations  stipulates  explicitly  that  the  primary   responsibility  of  the  Security  Council  is  to  maintain   international  peace  and  security.  The  United  Nations   organs   each   have   their   own   respective   functions    and  mandates.  The  Security  Council  is  not  a  forum   designed  for  involvement  in  human  rights  issues,  and   still  less  should  human  rights  issues  be  politicized.   Currently,  international  peace  and  security  are  faced   with   numerous   daunting   challenges.   The   Security    Council should strictly abide by its responsibilities and  concentrate  on  addressing  issues  that  really  concern   international peace and security. The  situation  on  the  Korean  peninsula  remains   complex   and   sensitive.   Upholding   the   goal   of   the    denuclearization  of  the  peninsula,  maintaining  peace   and stability on the peninsula and insisting on dialogue  and  consultations  as  a  way  to  resolve  issues  is  in  the   common  interests  of  all  parties  concerned  and  should   be the direction towards which all parties should work  together.   The   Security   Council   should   work   more    to  facilitate  dialogue  and  ease  tensions  and  refrain   from  doing  anything  that  might  cause  an  escalation   of  tensions.  The  Security  Council’s  inclusion  of  the   Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea  situation  on   its  agenda  in  order  to  involve  itself  of  the  situation  of   human  rights  in  that  country  will  work  against  those   goals and can only do harm rather than good.",Mr. Liu Jieyi,The situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,7353,2014-12-23
"The  Security  Council  has  just  adopted  resolution  1874   (2009) on the nuclear test conducted by the Democratic  People’s    Republic    of    Korea.    On    25    May,    the     Democratic   People’s   Republic   of   Korea   conducted    another   nuclear   test   in   disregard   of   the   common    objection  of  the  international  community.  The  Chinese   Ministry   for   Foreign   Affairs   issued   a   statement    expressing its firm opposition.  We    strongly    urge    the    Democratic    People’s     Republic   of   Korea   to   honour   its   commitment   to    denuclearization,  cease  all  actions  that  may  exacerbate   the situation and return to th e Six-Party Talks. China is  committed, as always, to sa feguarding the international  nuclear    non-proliferation    regime,    promoting    the     denuclearization    of    the    Korean    peninsula    and     maintaining peace and stability there and in North-East  Asia.  In     conducting     another     nuclear     test,     the      Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea  violated  the   relevant  resolutions  of  the  Security  Council,  impaired   the   effectiveness   of   the    international   nuclear   non- proliferation  regime  and  af fected  regional  peace  and   stability.   We   support   an   appropriate   and   balanced    reaction  of  the  Security  Council  to  the  Democratic   People’s Republic of Korea’s nuclear test.  The  provisions  of  resolution  1874  (2009)  are  in   line  with  Article  41  of  Ch apter  VII  of  the  United   Nations  Charter.  The  resolution  not  only  demonstrates   the  international  community’s  firm  opposition  to  the   Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea’s  nuclear  test,   but  also  sends  a  positive  signal  to  that  country.  It   reflects  the  firm  determinati on  of  the  Security  Council   to  resolve  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea   nuclear    issue    peacefully    through    dialogue    and     negotiation.  In  that  context,  the  Chinese  delegation   voted in favour of resolution 1874 (2009).  It   should   be   stressed   that   the   sovereignty,    territorial  integrity  and  le gitimate  security  concerns   and  development  interests  of  the  Democratic  People’s   Republic  of  Korea  must  be  respected.  Once  it  returns   to   the   Treaty   on   the   Non-Proliferation   of   Nuclear    Weapons,  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea,   as  a  State  party,  will  enjoy  the  right  to  enjoy  the   peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The Security Council’s  actions   should   not   adversely   impact   the   economic    viability   or   the   development   of   the   Democratic    People’s   Republic   of   Korea   or   the   delivery   of    humanitarian assistance to the country.  As    indicated    in    the    relevant    paragraph    of     resolution  1874  (2009),  if  the  Democratic  People’s   Republic    of    Korea    complie s    with    the    relevant     provisions  of  the  resolution,  the  Security  Council  will   review the appropriateness of suspending or lifting the  measures it has imposed.  I  wish  to  stress  that  the  issue  of  cargo  inspection   is   complex   and   sensitive.   Countries   need   to   act    prudently  and  in  strict  accordance  with  domestic  and   international  law  and  on  the  condition  of  reasonable   grounds  and  sufficient  evidence.  All  parties  should   refrain  from  any  word  or  deed  that  could  exacerbate   the  conflict.  Under  no  circumstances  should  force  be   used or threatened.  The    Chinese    Government    has    consistently     advocated a peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue on  the  Korean  peninsula  through  political  and  diplomatic   means. China has made tremendous efforts to that end.  We initiated the Six-Party Talks and pushed for a joint  statement by the six parties in September 2005. Thanks  to  the  concerted  efforts  of   all  parties,  the  Six-Party   Talks  made  some  initial  progr ess.  At  present,  despite   the  second  nuclear  test  undertaken  by  the  Democratic   People’s  Republic  of  Korea  —  which  represents  a   negative  development  —  we  remain  of  the  view  that   Security Council actions are not all about sanctions and  that political and diplomatic means are the only way to  resolve       the       relevant       issues,       achieve       the        denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and safeguard  peace and stability in North-East Asia.  In    the    current    circumstances,    the    parties     concerned  should  remain  calm,  exercise  restraint  and   refrain  from  actions  that  may  aggravate  the  situation.   Such  behaviour  would  serve  the  common  interests  of   all  parties.  China  will  conti nue  to  act  in  a  responsible   and  constructive  manner  to  strengthen  contacts  among   the  parties  concerned,  address  the  issue  appropriately,   work  for  an  early  resumption  of  the  Six-Party  Talks   and     play     an     active     role     in     achieving     the      denuclearization    of    the    Korean    peninsula    and     maintaining peace and stability there and in North-East  Asia.",Mr. Zhang Yesui,Non-proliferation/Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,6141,2009-06-12
"The  Security  Council  has  just  adopted  a  resolution  on   the  nuclear  test  by  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic   of Korea.  On  9  October  2006,  the  Democratic  People’s   Republic  of  Korea  flagrantly  conducted  a  nuclear  test   in    disregard    of    the    common    opposition    of    the     international   community.   This   is   not   conducive   to    peace and stability in North-East Asia. The Ministry of  Foreign  Affairs  of  China  issued  a  statement  on  the   same  day  and  expressed  firm  opposition  to  this  act.   Proceeding from the overall interests of bringing about  denuclearization    of    the    Korean    peninsula    and     maintaining    peace    and    stability    on    the    Korean     peninsula  and  in  North-East  Asia,  China  supports  the   Security   Council   in   making   firm   and   appropriate    response.  We  believe  that  the  action  of  the  Security   Council  should  both  indicate  the  firm  position  of  the   international   community   and   help   create   enabling    conditions   for   the   final   peaceful   solution   to   the    Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea  nuclear  issue   through  dialogue.  As  the  resolution  basically  reflects   the aforementioned spirit, the Chinese delegation voted  in favour of it.  China  would  like  to  reiterate  here  that  sanctions   in  themselves  are  not  the  end.  As  stipulated  by  the   relevant provisions of the resolution, if the Democratic  People’s Republic of Korea complies with the relevant  requests  of  the  resolution,  the  Security  Council  will   suspend   or   lift   sanctions    against   the   Democratic    People’s Republic of Korea.   At the same time, we wish to point out that China  does not approve of the practice of inspecting cargo to  and  from  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea.   We   therefore   have   reservations   about   the   relevant    provisions  of  the  resolution.  China  strongly  urges  the   countries concerned to adopt a prudent and responsible  attitude  in  this  regard  and  to  refrain  from  taking  any   provocative steps that may intensify the tension.  The   Chinese   Government   has   all   along   been    committed  to  bringing  about   the  denuclearization  of   the   Korean   peninsula   and   maintaining   peace   and    stability  on  the  Korean  peninsula  and  in  North-East   Asia.  We  have  always  advocated  seeking  a  peaceful   solution  to  the  nuclear  issue  on  the  Korean  peninsula   through  diplomatic  means.  China  has  made  enormous   and unremitting efforts to that end. It initiated the Six- Party  Talks  and  pushed  parties  concerned  to  reach  the   Joint   Statement   of   September   2005.   Although   the    negative   development   of   the   Democratic   People’s    Republic   of   Korea   nuclear   test   has   emerged,   our    policies  as  just  outlined  re main  unchanged.  We  still   believe that the Six-Party Talks are the realistic way to  handle  the  relevant  issues.  We  also  firmly  oppose  the   use  of  force.  China  has  noted  with  satisfaction  that  in   condemning   the   nuclear   test   of   the   Democratic    People’s Republic of Korea, the parties concerned have  all  indicated  the  importance  of  adhering  to  diplomatic   efforts.           China     believes     that     under     the     current      circumstances  we  should  unswervingly  stick  to  the   objective   of   the   denuclearization   of   the   Korean    peninsula,  oppose  nuclear  proliferation,  adhere  to  the   general   direction   of   resolving   the   issue   through    peaceful  dialogue  and  negotiation,  avoid  any  acts  that   may  cause  the  tension  to  escalate  and  the  situation  to   get  out  of  control,  and  main tain  peace  and  stability  on   the Korean peninsula and in North-East Asia. This is in  the  common  interests  of  all  the  parties  concerned.  All   the parties should make vigorous and positive efforts to  this  end.  China  is  ready  and  willing  to  strengthen   consultations   and   coordination   with   other   parties    concerned  so  as  to  respond  in  a  cool-headed  manner,   push forward the six-party process and continue to play  a     constructive     role     in     bringing     about     the      denuclearization    of    the    Korean    peninsula    and  maintaining    peace    and    stability    on    the    Korean     peninsula and in North-East Asia",Mr. Wang Guangya,Non-proliferation/Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,5551,2006-10-14
"The  Chinese  delegation  welcomes  the  draft  resolution   on   the   launching   of   missiles   by   the   Democratic    People’s  Republic  of  Korea,  unanimously  adopted  by   the Security Council earlier.   On   5   July   2006   local   time,   the   Democratic    People’s  Republic  of  Korea  launched  a  number  of   missiles  without  adequate  advance  notification,  which   caused     extensive     concern     in     the     international      community. Many countries have expressed their grave  concern  at  that  negative  development.  They  are  afraid   that   it   will   have   a   negative   impact   on   peace   and    stability  in  North-East  Asia,  especially  on  the  Korean   peninsula.  As  a  close  neighbour  of  the  Democratic  People’s   Republic  of  Korea,  China  is  gravely  concerned  about   the newly emerged complicating factors on the Korean  peninsula.   China   has   always   been   committed   to    maintaining    peace    and    stability    on    the    Korean     peninsula  and  has  insisted  on  resolving  the  relevant   issues  through  peaceful  dialogue  and  negotiations.  We   oppose  any  acts  leading  to  tension  on  the  Korean   peninsula.  We  hope  that  all  the  parties  concerned  will   keep  in  mind  the  overall  interests  and  make  a  greater   contribution   to   peace   and   stability   on   the   Korean    peninsula.  The  Chinese  side  is  ready  to  make  joint   efforts  with  all  the  parties  concerned  to  overcome   difficulties,  create  the  right  conditions,  promote  the   six-party  talks  and  jointly   maintain  peace  and  stability   on the Korean peninsula and in North-East Asia.  Ever  since  discussions  started  in  the  Security   Council on the launching of missiles by the Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea,  China  has  acted  in  a   persistent  manner  to  achieve  two  major  objectives,   namely,  to  maintain  peace   and  stability  on  the  Korean   peninsula  and  to  keep  the  Security  Council  united.  We   have  consistently  advocated  that  the  Council  respond   in  an  appropriate  manner  as  soon  as  possible,  send  a   unified    message    to    the    international    community,     reactivate  a  new  round  of  diplomatic  efforts  and  bring   about the early resumption of the six-party talks.  China  has  adopted  a  resp onsible  attitude  and  is   firmly  opposed  to  forcing  through  a  vote  on  a  draft   resolution that is not conducive to unity and that would  further  complicate  and  aggravate  the  situation,  cause   grave  consequenc es  for  peace  and  stability  on  the   Korean  peninsula  and  create  enormous  obstacles  for   the   six-party   talks   and   other   important   diplomatic    endeavours.  At  the  same  time,  China  and  Russia  put  forward   elements   for   a   draft   presidential   statement   and,    subsequently,    for    a    draft    resolution.    We    made     constructive  and  vigorous  efforts  to  seek  consensus  on   this issue among Security Council members.  Under  the  current  circumstances,  China  urges  all   the  parties  concerned  to  exercise  restraint.  We  are   opposed  to  any  acts  leading  to  further  tension  on  the   Korean peninsula. We hope that the resolution that has  just been adopted will help  all the parties concerned to  act   in   a   calm   manner   and   to   continue   diplomatic    endeavours   aimed   at   the   denuclearization   of   the    Korean  peninsula  and  the  normalization  of  relations   between  the  countries  concerned.  Maintaining  peace   and stability on the Korean peninsula is in the common  interests of the international community and the North- East  Asian  countries  and  is  the  fundamental  starting   point  for  China  in  handling  Korean  peninsula  affairs.   China  will  continue  to  make  steadfast  efforts  to  that   end. ",Mr. Wang Guangya,Democratic People's Republic of Korea,5490,2006-07-15
"The continued escalation of tensions on the Korean peninsula  in  recent  times  has  cause  widespread  concerns  in   the  international  community.  If  the  tensions  on  the   peninsula  are  not  kept  under  control,  in  particular  in   the  case  of  unexpected  events,  it  is  highly  likely  that   the situation will take a drastic turn for the worse and  spiral  out  of  control.  There  is  no  lack  of  such  painful   lessons in history; we must remain on high alert. To  that  end,  China  believes  that  today’s  Security   Council  meeting  is  necessary.  We  thank  Secretary- General  Guterres  for  his  briefing  to  the  Council.  We   hope  that  the  parties  can  reach  consensus  in  order  to   fully  implement  Security  Council  resolutions  related   to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, thereby  intensifying  efforts  to  promote  peace  talks  to  bring   the  nuclear  issue  on  the  Korean  peninsula  back  on   the  path  towards  a  negotiated  solution.  With  regard   to the nuclear issue on the peninsula, China’s position  is  clear:  no  matter  how  the  situation  may  develop,  we   must adhere to the following two basic paths. First,  we  must  remain  committed  to  the  goal  of   denuclearization,   which   is   the   basic   precondition    necessary  for  long-term  peace  and  stability  on  the   peninsula that we must achieve in order to safeguard the  international  nuclear  non-proliferation  regime.  Come   what  may,  we  should  never  waver  in  our  commitment   to achieving that goal. To that end, China’s position of  opposing the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s  research,   development   and   possession   of   nuclear    weapons remains rock solid. We are firmly committed  to the implementation of all relevant Security Council  resolutions. We urge the Democratic People’s Republic  of  Korea  to  stop  its  nuclear-  and  missile-development   activities, return to its commitment to denuclearization  and  honour  its  denuclearization  obligations.  At  the   same  time,  we  also  call  on  other  parties  concerned   to    demonstrate    political    wisdom,    take    political     steps  and  work  constructively  together  towards  the   denuclearization of the peninsula. Secondly,  we  must  remain  committed  to  taking   the  path  of  resolving  issues  through  dialogue  and   negotiations. The use of force does not solve differences  and leads only to bigger disasters. As the only solution,  dialogue  and  negotiations  also  represent  the  sensible   choice for all parties. Our past experience with regard  to  resolving  the  nuclear  issue  on  the  peninsula  has   shown  that  whenever  there  is  recourse  to  dialogue   and  negotiations,  basic  stability  on  the  peninsula  is   maintained,  and  efforts  towards  denulcearization  can   yield results. During the five-year period from 2003 to  2007,  when  the  parties  were  engaged  in  dialogue  and   negotiations,  three  joint  documents  were  adopted.  In  particular, the 19 September joint statement in 2005 set  out the road map for the Democratic People’s Republic  of  Korea’s  abandonment  of  all  nuclear  programmes   and  the  realization  of  peace  on  the  peninsula.  Even   today,  the  joint  statement  still  carries  major  positive   significance and has been reaffirmed and acknowledged  by  all  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea-related   resolutions adopted by the Security Council. Since  dialogue  and  negotiations  came  to  a  halt   in  2008,  the  situation  on  the  peninsula  has  gradually   spiralled   out   of   control.   The   Democratic   People’s    Republic  of  Korea  has  accelerated  its  nuclear-missile   development  process  and  conducted  four  nuclear  tests   and  dozens  of  missile  launches.  We  therefore  hope   that all parties will devote greater efforts to seeking a  political settlement through dialogue and consultations,  as required by the relevant Security Council resolutions.  China is not a focal point for resolving the problem on  the  peninsula.  The  key  to  solving  the  nuclear  issue   on  the  peninsula  does  not  rest  in  the  hands  of  China.   However,   as   a   close   neighbouring   country   to   the    peninsula,  with  a  responsible  attitude  with  regard  to   peace  and  stability  there  and  in  the  region,  China  has   made  unrelenting  efforts  and  played  a  unique  role  in   promoting  a  negotiated  solution  of  the  issue  over  the   years.  Through  China’s  efforts  and  the  support  of  all   parties, the three-party talks on the nuclear issue on the  peninsula was expanded to include six parties. In   the   current   circumstances,   China   remains    prepared to work with all parties to contribute anew to  the settlement of the nuclear issue on the peninsula. In  view  of  recent  developments  on  the  peninsula,  China   has put forward a double suspension proposal that builds  on the dual-track approach, which we proposed earlier.  The   dual-track   approach   aims   to   promote   parallel    progress in the denuclearization of the peninsula and the  establishment  of  a  peace  mechanism  on  the  peninsula   in   a   synchronized   and   reciprocal   manner,   thereby    ultimately  achieving  both  goals  together.  The  double   suspension  proposal,  which  calls  for  the  suspension   of  nuclear  and  missile  activities  by  the  Democratic   People’s  Republic  of  Korea  and  the  suspension  of   large-scale military exercises by the United States and  the  Republic  of  Korea,  seeks  to  bring  both  sides  back   to the negotiating table, thereby initiating the first step  of that approach. China’s  proposals  have  taken  into  consideration   both the short- and long-term goals, while making them  complementary to one another. While they are designed  to  address  the  most  pressing  concerns  of  the  parties,   they also pave the way towards denuclearization. They  are  consistent  with  the  requirements  of  the  relevant   Security   Council   resolutions   and   the   fundamental    interests  of  all  parties,  including  those  of  the  United   States and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.  The   proposals   are   objective,   impartial,   reasonable    and  practical,  and  are  gaining  the  understanding  and   support  of  an  increasing  number  of  countries.  We,  of   course, also know that some countries might continue  to have certain doubts. I would like to point out that the most urgent task  now  is  to  stop  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of   Korea’s  nuclear  and  missile  development.  To  achieve   that  goal,  it  is  necessary  to  put  aside  the  debate  over   who  should  take  the  first  step  and  stop  arguing  over   who  is  right  and  wrong.  Rather,  we  should  start  from   the  low-hanging  fruits  and  remove  flash  points  so   as  to  engender  peace  on  the  peninsula  and  establish   conditions conducive to stability in the region. In that  regard, I also want to stress that the state of affairs of  the  peninsula  issue  is  not  caused  by  any  one  single   party,  and  it  is  not  realistic  to  ask  one  party  alone  to   assume   all   the   responsibilities   in   connection   with    resolving the issue. As President Xi Jinping said, only  with  all  relevant  parties  shouldering  their  respective   responsibilities   and   meeting   one   another   half-way    will  there  be  a  timely  solution  to  the  nuclear  issue  on   the peninsula. We  call  upon  all  parties,  especially  those  directly   concerned by the issue, namely, the Democratic People’s  Republic  of  Korea  and  the  United  States,  to  show  a   sincere  desire  for  dialogue  and  restart  the  dialogue   process. Furthermore, we look to the Council to build  further consensus and speak with a more unified voice.  At the same time, China will remain open to all useful  proposals  from  the  parties.  All  ideas  conducive  to   resuming dialogue and negotiations aimed at achieving  denuclearization  and  maintaining  peace  and  stability   on  the  peninsula  are  welcomed  for  consideration  in   our discussions. As we meet for this special ministerial meeting of  the Security Council, China calls on all parties to make  concerted efforts to address two urgent tasks. First, we call for a de-escalation of the situation on  the peninsula as rapidly as possible. Given the gravity  of the situation on the peninsula, China strongly urges  all parties to remain calm, exercise restraint and avoid  provocative  rhetoric  or  actions  that  could  lead  to  a   miscalculation. I want to stress that there is, and should  be, no double standard with regard to this issue. While  we  demand  that  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of   Korea observe the relevant Security Council resolutions  and stop advancing its nuclear and missile development,  we  also  demand  that  the  United  States,  the  Republic   of Korea and other parties refrain from conducting, or  even expanding, military exercises directed against the  Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Secondly,   all   parties   should   comprehensively    respect  and  fully  implement  the  Democratic  People’s   Republic of Korea-related Security Council resolutions.  In addition to introducing sanctions on the Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea,  the  resolutions  that  have   been  adopted  to  date  also  call  for  resuming  the  Six- Party  Talks,  avoiding  an  escalation  of  tensions  and   committing  to  dialogue.  In  another  words,  imposing   sanctions   and   resuming   talks   are   both   efforts   to    implement  the  relevant  Security  Council  resolutions.   We  cannot  choose  one  over  the  other,  or  implement   only what we see fit. As a response to the accelerated  progress of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s  nuclear   and   missile   development,   the   international    community  needs  to  step  up  non-proliferation  efforts.   In response to the progressive escalation of tensions on  the peninsula, it is also necessary for the parties to step  up efforts to promote peace talks. Those two stepping- up actions can help promote the peaceful settlement of  the nuclear issue on the peninsula. The Chinese word for  crisis contains two characters, which respectively mean  danger and opportunity. Danger embodies opportunity  and engenders opportunity. In China’s view, now is the  time to seriously consider resuming talks. Before concluding, I would like to reiterate China’s  firm  opposition  against  the  United  States  deployment   of  the  Terminal  High  Altitude  Area  Defense  system   in  the  Republic  of  Korea.  It  is  a  move  that  seriously   undermines   the   strategic   security   of   China   and    other  countries  in  the  region  and  damages  trust  and   cooperation   among   the   parties   in   connection   with    the  peninsula  issue.  It  is  detrimental  to  achieving   denuclearization  and  maintaining  long-term  stability   on  the  peninsula.  China  once  again  urges  the  relevant   parties to immediately stop the deployment process. Let us make joint efforts to promote denuclearization  and uphold stability on the peninsula based on mutual  respect and trust.",Mr. Wang Yi,Non-proliferation/Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,7932,2017-04-28
"Relevant Security Council resolutions include explicit provisions  against   any   launches   by   the   Democratic   People’s    Republic  of  Korea  using  ballistic  missile  technology.   China  is  opposed  to  the  launches  conducted  by  the   Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea.  Resolution   2356   (2017),   adopted   by   the   Council   today,   has    demonstrated  the  united  position  of  the  international   community  against  the  development  of  nuclear  and   missile   programmes   by   the   Democratic   People’s    Republic  of  Korea.  At  the  same  time,  the  resolution   reiterates  the  importance  of  maintaining  peace  and   stability  on  the  Korean  peninsula  and  in  North-East   Asia  at  large,  expresses  a  commitment  to  a  peaceful,   diplomatic  and  political  solution  to  the  situation  and   stresses  the  importance  of  reducing  tension  on  the   peninsula by the parties concerned. China calls on all parties to fully and comprehensively  implement  Security  Council  resolutions  related  to  the   Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and strive for a  peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue on the peninsula  via  redoubled  efforts  to  promote  non-proliferation,   peace   and   dialogue.   The   current   situation   on   the    peninsula  is  complex  and  sensitive.  At  the  same  time,   there  is  a  critical  window  of  opportunity  for  a  return   to the right track of seeking a settlement to the nuclear  issue on the peninsula through dialogue and negotiation.  It  is  incumbent  upon  all  parties  concerned  to  exercise   restraint and do more to help ease the tension and build  mutual trust, rather than to the contrary.  As  a  close  neighbour  of  the  Korean  peninsula,   China   has   always   insisted   on   denuclearizing   the    peninsula,   maintaining   peace   and   stability   on   the    peninsula and seeking a solution through dialogue and  negotiations.  China  has  always  been  firmly  opposed   to  chaos  and  conflict  on  the  peninsula.  Based  on   developments  on  the  peninsula,  China  has  proposed   the dual-track approach of promoting parallel progress  in  denuclearization  efforts  and  the  establishment  of   a  peace  mechanism  on  the  peninsula.  China  has  also   put  forward  the  suspension-for-suspension  proposal,   which would allow for the suspension of nuclear missile  activities by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  and  the  suspension  of  massive  military  exercises  by   the  United  States  and  the  Republic  of  Korea.  Those   proposals are pragmatic and feasible. We hope they will  be seriously considered and will receive a constructive  response by the parties concerned.  For  its  part,  China  is  open  to  helpful  proposals   by all parties. We hope that all parties concerned will  work  with  China  to  keep  pushing  for  dialogue  and   negotiations in order to seek a solution to the problems  on  the  Korean  peninsula  within  the  framework  of  the   Six-Party  Talks  and  continue  to  work  actively  and   constructively towards to goal of early denuclearization  and lasting peace and security on the Korean peninsula.",Mr. Liu Jieyi,Non-proliferation/Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,7958,2017-06-02
"The  Security  Council  resolutions  regarding  this   issue contain explicit provisions forbidding any launch  by  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea  using   ballistic-missile  technology.  The  Democratic  People’s   Republic   of   Korea’s   launch   of   a   ballistic   missile    on  4  July  was  a  flagrant  violation  of  the  relevant   Council  resolutions  and  defied  the  will  of  the  entire   international  community.  China  finds  it  unacceptable   and strongly urges the Democratic People’s Republic of  Korea to abide strictly by the decisions of the Security  Council and to put a stop to any rhetoric or action that  might  further  exacerbate  tensions  on  the  peninsula.   At the same time, we call on all the parties concerned  to   exercise   restraint,   avoid   provocative   actions   or    belligerent  rhetoric,  demonstrate  a  desire  for  dialogue   without conditions and work actively together to defuse  the tension. On 4 July, the Heads of State of China and Russia  exchanged   views   on   the   situation   on   the   Korean    peninsula and agreed that the nuclear issue there should  be  resolved  through  dialogue  and  consultation.  Our   Foreign Ministries issued a joint statement expressing  China and Russia’s shared position and concern regarding  the  issue  of  the  Korean  peninsula.  The  statement  laid   out our two countries’ joint initiative, based on China’s  two-track  approach,  and  a  suspension-for-suspension   proposal under Russia’s step-by-step plan. The current  situation  on  the  peninsula  is  complex  and  sensitive,   and  the  dialogue  process  is  at  a  standstill.  China  and   Russia’s joint initiative is aimed at addressing both the  symptoms and the root causes and at taking integrated  measures  to  strive  for  a  solution.  It  is  objective,  fair,   reasonable  and  feasible.  We  hope  that  it  will  have  the   support  of  the  international  community  and  help  to   open  a  realistic  route  to  resolving  the  problem  of  the   Korean peninsula. China   has   always   insisted   on   the   importance    of  achieving  the  denuclearization  of  the  peninsula,   maintaining  peace  and  stability  there  and  seeking  a   solution  through  dialogue  and  consultation.  We  have   always been firmly opposed to chaos and conf lict in the  region, and military means should not be considered an  option in that regard. The deployment of the Terminal  High  Altitude  Area  Defense  system  in  North-East   Asia  seriously  undermines  the  strategic  security  of   the  countries  of  the  region,  including  China.  As  such,   it  is  not  conducive  to  denuclearizing  the  peninsula  or   achieving  regional  peace  and  stability.  China  urges   the   countries   concerned   to   cancel   its   deployment    immediately.   The   denuclearization   of   the   Korean    peninsula  and  the  achievement  of  lasting  peace  and   stability  there  are  in  the  interests  of  all.  We  hope  that   the parties concerned will work together with China and  duly play their roles and shoulder their responsibilities,  with a view to getting the Korean peninsula issue back  on the track of peaceful dialogue as soon as possible.",Mr. Liu Jieyi,Non-proliferation/Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,7996,2017-07-05
"The  Security  Council  resolutions  on  this  subject  contain   explicit   provisions   against   any   launches   by   the    Democratic People’s Republic of Korea using ballistic- missile   technology.   China   opposes   the   Democratic    People’s   Republic   of   Korea’s   launching   activities,    which violate Council resolutions and defy the will of  the entire international community. We  have  always  insisted  on  the  importance  of   denuclearizing the Korean peninsula, upholding peace  and  stability  there  and  seeking  a  solution  through   dialogue and consultation. We have always been firmly  opposed to chaos and conflict on the peninsula. In our  view, that is what resolution 2371 (2017) is all about. Its  unanimous adoption by the Council demonstrates that  the international community has a united position with  regard to the nuclear issue on the peninsula. There    are    three    major    components    to    this     resolution. First, it sets out further sanctions targeting  the  nuclear  and  missile  programme  of  the  Democratic   People’s  Republic  of  Korea.  Secondly,  the  resolution   does  not  intend  to  impact  negatively  activities  that   are not prohibited by the resolution, such as economic  activities  and  cooperation,  or  food  and  humanitarian   assistance.   Thirdly,   it   calls   for   the   resumption   of    the  Six-Party  Talks,  commits  to  finding  a  solution   through  peaceful,  diplomatic  and  political  means,  and   stresses  the  importance  of  de-escalating  tensions  on   the peninsula by the parties concerned. China believes  that  these  are  part  and  parcel  of  this  resolution,  and   all  parties  should  implement  the  provisions  contained   therein fully and earnestly. China has been making tireless efforts to promote  the  denuclearization  of  the  peninsula  and  to  uphold   peace and stability there. On 4 July, China and Russia  issued  a  joint  statement  on  the  issue  of  the  Korean   peninsula.  Both  of  our  countries  put  forward  a  road   map  for  the  resolution  of  this  issue,  which  is  based   respectively on China’s idea of a due approach, which  calls  for  parallel  efforts,  while  moving  forward  with   both  the  denuclearization  of  the  peninsula  and  the   establishment  of  a  peace  mechanism  based  on  the   suspension for suspension initiative, which calls for the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea  to  suspend  its   nuclear and missile activities, and for the United States  and the Republic of Korea to suspend their large-scale  military  exercises,  as  well  as  on  Russia’s  step-by-step   approach. This China-Russia joint initiative is realistic  and  feasible.  It  aims  to  tackle  both  the  symptoms  and   the  root  causes  of  the  problem  and  to  seek  a  solution   through  an  integrated  approach.  We  hope  that  this   initiative will receive a response and support from the  relevant parties. China  has  taken  note  that  the  United  States  has   recently  indicated  once  again  that  it  is  not  seeking  a   regime change or a regime collapse in the Democratic  People’s Republic of Korea, and that it is in no hurry to  push for the reunification of the peninsula. The United  States  has  also  indicated  that  its  troops  will  not  push   through  the  thirty-eighth  parallel.  It  is  our  hope  that   the  United  States  will  translate  these  “four  no’s”  into   concrete   policies   towards   the   Democratic   People’s    Republic  of  Korea.  Beefing  up  military  deployment   on  the  peninsula  is  not  in  the  interest  of  realizing   denuclearization there or of maintaining regional peace  and  stability.  The  deployment  of  the  Terminal  High   Altitude Area Defence missile system will not bring a  solution to the issue of the Democratic People’s Republic  of Korea’s nuclear testing and missile launching. What  it will do is seriously undermine the strategic balance  of the region. As such, it is detrimental to the strategic  security interest of regional countries, including China. China  strongly  urges  the  parties  concerned  to   halt  the  process  of  this  deployment  and  to  dismantle   relevant   equipment.   Realizing   denuclearization   and    durable  peace  and  stability  on  the  Korean  peninsula   is  in  the  interests  of  all  the  parties.  China  urges  the   Democratic   People’s   Republic   of   Korea   to   respect    Council  resolutions  and  to  cease  taking  actions  that   might further escalate tensions on the peninsula. We hope that the parties concerned will immediately  take  effective  action  to  prevent  the  situation  from   further escalating, create conditions for the resumption  of talks and undertake efforts to bring, at an early date,  the nuclear issue of the peninsula back to the right track,  that  of  seeking  a  peaceful  solution  through  dialogue   and consultation.",Mr. Liu Jieyi,Non-proliferation/Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,8019,2017-08-05
"The  relevant  Security  Council  resolutions  contain  clear   provisions regarding the Democratic People’s Republic  of   Korea’s   launch   activities   with   ballistic   missile    technology. China opposes such launch activities by the  Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, in violation of  Council resolutions. We call on the Democratic People’s  Republic  of  Korea  to  comply  with  the  provisions  of   the  resolutions  and  on  all  relevant  parties  to  exercise   restraint,   avoid   mutually   provocative   actions   that    might   exacerbate   the   situation   in   the   region,   and    work  together  to  safeguard  peace  and  stability  on  the   Korean peninsula. Resolution 2371 (2017), adopted by the Council on  5  August,  provides  for  further  sanctions  against  the   nuclear  and  missile  programmes  of  the  Democratic   People’s Republic of Korea. It calls for the resumption  of  the  Six-Party  Talks,  pledges  to  seek  a  peaceful,   diplomatic   and   political   solution   to   the   problem,    and   underscores   the   importance   of   de-escalation    efforts  on  the  part  of  the  relevant  parties.  All  parties   involved   should   implement   the   relevant   provisions    of  the  resolutions  of  the  Council  in  a  comprehensive,   integrated  manner,  avoid  any  rhetoric  or  action  that   might exacerbate tensions on the peninsula, and create  the conditions necessary for the resumption of dialogue. The  suspension-for-suspension  proposal  and  the   dual-track  approach  put  forward  by  China  represent  a   realistic and feasible formula for the proper settlement  of the issue on the Korean peninsula. We hope that all  the  relevant  parties  will  give  it  serious  consideration   and  respond  positively,  working  with  China  to  open   effective paths for the settlement of the peninsula issue.  China  has  always  been  committed  to  the  goal  of  the   denuclearization  of  the  peninsula,  the  maintenance  of   peace and stability on the peninsula, and the settlement  of the issue through dialogue and consultations. China  is  opposed  to  any  chaos  or  war  on  the   peninsula.     Enhancing     military     deployment     on      the  peninsula  will  not  help  to  achieve  the  goal  of   denuclearization or regional stability. The deployment  of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in  North-East Asia severely jeopardizes regional strategic  balance and undermines the strategic security interests  of   all   regional   countries,   including   China.   It   will    further escalate tensions on the peninsula, making the  issue more complicated and intractable. China   urges   the   relevant   parties   to   halt   the    deployment  process  and  dismantle  related  facilities   immediately.  China  also  urges  countries  to  end  the   practice of resorting to domestic legislation to impose  unilateral sanctions on individuals and entities in other  countries.   Achieving   denuclearization   and   lasting    peace and security on the peninsula is in the interests of  all parties. We hope that the relevant parties can, along  with China, play their due role and assume their share  of  responsibility  to  restore  the  peninsula  issue  to  the   right track of peaceful resolution through dialogue.",Mr. Liu Jieyi,Non-proliferation/Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,8034,2017-08-29
"On  3   September,   despite   the   broad   opposition   of   the    international   community,   the   Democratic   People’s    Republic of Korea disregarded the relevant resolutions  of  the  Security  Council  and  once  again  conducted   a  nuclear  test.  The  Chinese  Government  resolutely   opposes   and   strongly   condemns   the   nuclear   test    conducted  by  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of   Korea  in  violation  of  Security  Council  resolutions.   Achieving the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula  and  maintaining  the  nuclear  non-proliferation  system   and  peace  and  stability  in  North-East  Asia  constitute   the  firm  stand  of  the  Chinese  Government,  as  well  as   the  overall  aspiration  of  the  international  community.   We  strongly  urge  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic   of  Korea  to  face  up  squarely  to  the  firm  will  of   the   international   community   on   the   issue   of   the    denuclearization  of  the  peninsula  and  earnestly  abide   by the relevant resolutions of the Council; stop taking  actions  that  are  wrong,  that  lead  to  the  deterioration   of  the  situation  and  that  are  not  in  line  with  its  own   interests; and to return to the track of solving the issue  through dialogue. The situation on the Korean peninsula continues to  deteriorate  as  we  speak,  falling  into  a  vicious  circle.   The   peninsula   issue   must   be   resolved   peacefully.    China will never allow chaos and war on the peninsula.  The  parties  concerned  must  strengthen  their  sense  of   urgency;  take  due  responsibility;  play  their  due  roles;   take  practical  measures;  make  joint  efforts  to  ease   the  situation  together;  restart  the  dialogue  and  talks;   and  prevent  further  deterioration  of  the  situation  on   the peninsula. China  and  Russia  proposed  a  two-track  approach   that promotes the denuclearization of the peninsula and  the establishment of a peace mechanism in parallel. The  suspension-for-suspension initiative, which calls for the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea  to  suspend  its   nuclear and missile activities and for the United States  and the Republic of Korea to suspend their large-scale  military  exercises,  and  the  step-by-step  concept  by   Russia  are  the  basis  on  which  both  countries  jointly   proposed  a  road  map  to  resolve  the  peninsula  issue.   That  joint  initiative  by  China  and  Russia  is  practical   and feasible and is aimed at addressing the most urgent  security concerns of the parties concerned; easing the  tension as soon as possible; preventing the continuous  escalation of the situation; achieving through dialogue  the denuclearization of the peninsula; and maintaining  the peace and stability of the peninsula and the region.  We  hope  that  the  parties  concerned  will  seriously   consider that proposal and actively respond to it. China  calls  upon  the  international  community  to   jointly  and  comprehensively  implement  the  relevant   resolutions of the Security Council on the Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea,  firmly  push  forward  the   goal  of  denuclearization  of  the  peninsula  and  firmly   maintain the peace and stability of the peninsula.",Mr. Liu Jieyi,Non-proliferation/Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,8039,2017-09-04
"On  3  September,  while   defying  the  general  opposition  on  the  part  of  the   international   community,   the   Democratic   People’s    Republic   of   Korea   conducted   yet   another   nuclear    test.  The  Chinese  Government  strongly  opposes  and   condemns such an act. China is consistently committed to denuclearizing  the  Korean  peninsula,  ensuring  peace  and  stability   on   the   peninsula   and   resolving   the   issue   through    dialogue   and   consultation.   The   Security   Council’s    adoption of resolution 2375 (2017) today reflects those  three  commitments  and  the  united  position  of  the   international  community  in  opposing  the  Democratic   People’s Republic of Korea’s development of its nuclear  and  ballistic  missile  capabilities  and  preserving  the   international non-proliferation regime. China  urges  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of   Korea to earnestly heed the expectations and will of the  international  community  to  halt  the  country’s  nuclear   and  missile  development,  effectively  abide  by  and   implement  the  Council’s  resolutions,  stop  any  further   nuclear and missile tests and effectively work towards  denuclearization.  At  the  same  time,  the  resolution   reiterates  the  need  to  maintain  peace  and  stability  on   the peninsula and in North-East Asia. It also commits  to  resolving  the  issue  through  peaceful,  diplomatic   and  political  means  and  supports  the  resumption  of   the Six-Party Talks, as well as the commitment voiced  in  the  statement  of  19  September  2005,  while  also   emphasizing  the  importance  of  de-escalating  tension   on  the  peninsula.  All  parties  should  effectively  and   comprehensively implement the relevant provisions set  out  in  Security  Council  resolutions.  The  nuclear  issue   on  the  Korean  peninsula  must  be  resolved  peacefully.   Comprehensive measures must be taken to balance the  legitimate security concerns of all parties. China   has   made   unremitting   efforts   towards    denuclearization  and  maintaining  peace  and  stability   on  the  peninsula.  On  4  July,  China  and  Russia  issued   a joint statement on the issue of the Korean peninsula,  based  on  China’s  proposal  of  a  dual-track  approach   of  promoting  the  denuclearization  of  the  peninsula   through a suspension-for-suspension approach. China  calls  on  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic   of  Korea  to  halt  its  nuclear  and  missile  activities,  and   on  the  United  States  and  the  Republic  of  Korea  to   suspend  their  large-scale  military  exercises,  in  line   with  Russia’s  proposal  for  a  step-by-step  approach.   China  and  Russia  have  formulated  a  road  map  for   the  solution  of  the  Korean  peninsula  issue.  The  joint   Chinese and Russian initiative is realistic and feasible.  It aims to tackle both the symptoms and root causes of  the  problem,  so  as  to  advance  the  peaceful  settlement   of the Korean peninsula nuclear issue and maintain the  peace  and  stability  of  the  peninsula.  In  that  vein,  we   hope  to  obtain  a  positive  response  and  backing  from   relevant parties. We  hope  that  the  United  States  will  incorporate   the  following  four  “don’ts”  into  its  relevant  policies   regarding  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea:   don’t seek regime change; don’t incite a collapse of the  regime; don’t seek an accelerated reunification effort of  the  peninsula;  and  don’t  send  its  military  north  of  the   thirty-eighth parallel. China is a close neighbour of the Korean peninsula.  We  have been consistently committed to its denuclearization  and are against any war or chaos on the territory. The  strengthening  of  military  deployment  on  the  Korean   peninsula and the goal of denuclearization and reaching  peace and stability run counter to each other. The  deployment  of  the  Terminal  High  Altitude   Area Defense system severely undermines the reaching  of a strategic balance. It also undermines the strategic  security  interests  of  the  countries  in  the  region,  of   which China is part. China strongly urges the relevant  parties  to  halt  its  deployment  and  remove  all  related   equipment.  At  present,  the  situation  on  the  peninsula   is  sensitive,  complex  and  grave.  The  relevant  parties   should remain calm and avoid a rhetoric or action that  could aggravate the tensions. The priority at present is  to comprehensively and strictly implement the relevant  Security Council resolutions, and the parties concerned  should resume talks and negotiations sooner rather than  later, endeavour to advance the denuclearization process  and maintain peace and stability on the peninsula. The  Council should shoulder its historical responsibility in  this regard. China   will   continue   to   advance   dialogue   and    consultations,  work  together  with  all  relevant  parties   and  make  a  positive  and  constructive  effort  to  ensure   that  an  appropriate  settlement  is  reached  at  an  early   date so as to resolve the current issue on the peninsula,  attain denuclearization and ensure long-term peace and  stability on the peninsula.",Mr. Liu Jieyi,Non-proliferation/Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,8042,2017-09-11
"I  wish  to  thank  Under-Secretary-General  Feltman  and   Ambassador Cardi for their briefings. The  relevant  Security  Council  resolutions  contain   explicit  provisions  on  launches  by  the  Democratic   People’s   Republic   of   Korea   using   ballistic   missile    technology.  China  expresses  its  great  concern  over   and  its  opposition  to  the  latest  missile  launch  by  the   Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea.  We  strongly   urge  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea  to   comply  with  the  relevant  Security  Council  resolutions   and  to  cease  actions  that  escalate  the  tensions  on  the   Korean peninsula. In  the  recent  past,  the  overall  situation  on  the   peninsula  was  stable,  which  provided  a  window  of   opportunity  for  diplomatic  efforts.  Regrettably,  that   window failed to lead to a resumption of dialogue and  negotiations. The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula  has  continued  for  more  than  two  decades.  During   that  period,  the  most  valuable  experience  gained  was   that  when  the  parties  moved  towards  each  other  and   engaged in honest interaction, there was the possibility  of  reaching  an  agreement.  And  the  most  important   lesson was that when the parties adopted a tough stance  and misjudged each other, the chances for peace would  escape them. This  year,  the  Security  Council  has  unamimously   adopted   resolutions   2356   (2017),   2371   (2017)   and    2375 (2017). Those resolutions demonstrate the united  position  of  the  international  community  against  the   development  by  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of   Korea of nuclear and ballistic missile capacities and of  upholding  the  international  non-proliferation  regime.   At  the  same  time,  they  underscore  the  importance   of   the   parties   concerned   reducing   tension   on   the    peninsula  and  reiterate  the  need  to  maintain  peace   and  stability  on  the  Korean  peninsula  and  in  North- East  Asia  as  a  whole  and  the  commitment  to  seeking   a  settlement  by  means  of  peaceful  diplomatic  and   political negotiations, while emphasizing that people’s  livelihoods  and  the  humanitarian  assistance  efforts  in   the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea should not  be negatively impacted. In view of the current grave situation on the Korean  peninsula, the top priority is for all parties concerned to  show restraint, implement comprehensively and strictly  the relevant Security Council resolutions, and strive for  an early resumption of dialogue and negotiations. China  has  always  supported  the  denuclearization   of the Korean peninsula as well as peace and stability  thereon.  China  has  consistently  advocated  dialogue   and  negotiations  as  a  means  of  achieving  a  settlement   and   prevent   conflict   and   chaos   on   the   peninsula,    and  it  has  worked  tirelessly  towards  that  goal.  China   has  put  forward  a  proposal  for  the  suspension  by  the   Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea  of  its  nuclear   and missile activities, as well as the suspension by the  United States and the Republic of Korea of large-scale  joint military exercises. China is proposing a dual-track approach aimed at  promoting parallel progress in denuclearization and the  establishment of a peace mechanism on the peninsula.  The Russian Federation, too, has put forward the idea of  a phased approach to the settlement of the issues facing  the Korean peninsula. On the basis of the aforementioned proposals, China  and  the  Russian  Federation  issued  a  joint  statement   on  4  July  proposing  a  road  map  for  the  settlement  of   the  problems  facing  the  Korean  peninsula.  The  joint   initiative by China and Russia is practical and feasible  and is aimed at promoting the peaceful settlement of the  nuclear issue on the peninsula and at maintaining peace  and stability there. As such, we hope that it will elicit a  response and support from the parties concerned. In the  current  situation,  the  Security  Council  must  shoulder   its  historical  responsibility  by  prompting  the  parties   to take integrated measures to settle problems through  peaceful  diplomatic  and  political  means  and  maintain   peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. China  will  continue  to  implement  the  relevant   Security  Council  resolutions  comprehensively  and  in   their entirety and, together with the parties concerned,  will continue to play an active and constructive role in  seeking  an  appropriate  settlement  of  the  nuclear  issue   on the Korean peninsula and an early realization of the  denuclearization  of  and  long-term  peace  and  stability   on  the  peninsula.  China  expects  that  all  the  parties   concerned,  in  particular  the  main  parties,  will  make   efforts to that end by honouring their commitments and  playing a constructive role. China   believes   that   the   work   of   the   Security    Council  Committee  established  pursuant  to  resolution   1718  (2006)  should  be  conducive  to  the  realization   of  the  denuclearization  of  the  Korean  peninsula,  the   maintenance  of  peace  and  stability  on  the  peninsula,   and the promotion of dialogue and negotiations among  the parties concerned, with a view to finding a solution.  The  Panel  of  Experts  must  act  in  strict  compliance   with  its  mandate  and  conduct  its  work  on  the  basis  of   the  principles  of  objectivity  and  impartiality  and  of   substantiated evidence. It is China’s consistent view that  the Security Council sanctions against the Democratic  People’s   Republic   of   Korea   should   not   negatively    impact the relevant humanitarian assistance activities.",Mr. Wu Haitao,Non-proliferation/Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,8118,2017-11-29
"China  is  opposed  to  the  Security  Council’s  proposed   consideration  of  the  human  rights  situation  in  the   Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea.  China  has   consistently  opposed  the  Council’s  involvement  in  the   human  rights  issues  of  other  countries.  The  Charter   of the United Nations has clear provisions with regard  to  the  functions  and  division  of  labour  of  the  main   organs of the Organization. The primary responsibility  of  the  Council  is  to  maintain  international  peace  and   security,  and  its  job  is  therefore  to  address  threats  to   that. The Security Council is not the appropriate forum  for debating human rights issues, nor should we allow  human rights issues to be politicized. China  is  committed  to  the  denuclearization  of  the   Korean peninsula and to upholding peace and stability  there  and  resolving  relevant  issues  through  dialogue   and  consultation.  We  are  opposed  to  war  and  conflict   on the peninsula. The current situation on the peninsula  remains    complex,    sensitive    and    grave.    Council     members  and  the  parties  concerned  should  engage  in   seeking  ways  to  ease  tensions  on  the  peninsula  and   avoid  mutual  provocation  and  words  or  actions  that   might further escalate the situation. A discussion by the Council of human rights issues  in  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea  would   run   counter   to   the   aforementioned   objectives   and    be  counterproductive.  China  hopes  that  the  parties   concerned  will  exercise  restraint  and  keep  the  overall   situation  in  mind.  They  should  move  towards  rather   than  away  from  one  another,  implement  the  relevant   Council  resolutions  comprehensively  and  fully,  and   give  serious  consideration  to  China’s  suspension-for- suspension initiative so as to create an environment and  conditions  conducive  to  a  resumption  of  negotiations.   China  hopes  that  the  parties  concerned  will  honour   their  commitments  effectively  and  play  a  constructive   role  in  maintaining  the  denuclearization  process  and   peace and stability on the peninsula.",Mr. Wu Haitao,The situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,8130,2017-12-11
"China would like to thank Secretary-General Guterres for his  briefing.   China   firmly   opposes   the   development   by   the    Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea  of  its  nuclear   and   ballistic   missile   programmes,   which   are   in    violation  of  the  relevant  Security  Council  resolutions.   China urges the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  to abide by those resolutions. Since  the  beginning  of  2017,  the  situation  on  the   Korean  peninsula  has  been  one  of  constant  tension.   While  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea   has  continued  to  conduct  nuclear  tests  and  missile   launches,  in  defiance  of  the  universal  opposition  by   the  international  community,  the  parties  concerned   have continued to expand military exercises and scale  up  their  shows  of  force.  The  escalation  of  tension  on   the  Korean  peninsula,  which  has  reached  the  point  of   risking spiralling out of control, is not in the interests  of any parties. The  nuclear  issue  of  the  Korean  peninsula  has   lasted  for  over  two  decades.  It  has  deep  historical   causes  and  takes  place  within  a  grave  and  complex   context.  Reviewing  the  evolution  of  the  nuclear  issue   of  the  Korean  peninsula,  we  can  see  that,  when  the   parties  concerned  have  tried  to  converge  and  respect   one another’s concerns, it has been possible to achieve  results. On the other hand, when the parties have taken  stubborn  stances  and  disregarded  the  security  of  the   other side, it has led to the deterioration of the situation.  The current situation on the Korean peninsula is mired  in a vicious cycle of tough posturing and confrontation,  which is hardly a cause for optimism about the future.  However,  the  hope  for  peace  is  not  totally  lost.  There   is  still  a  possibility  of  negotiations.  The  option  of   resorting  to  the  use  of  force  is  an  unacceptable  one.   China believes that all of the parties concerned should  keep in mind the broader goal of maintaining peace and  stability  on  the  Korean  peninsula,  judge  the  situation   calmly, make wise choices and take practical steps. First,  it  is  necessary  to  put  an  immediate  end   to   rhetoric   and   actions   that   are   unfavourable   to    denuclearization  and  the  peace  and  security  of  the   Korean  peninsula.  It  is  also  necessary  to  ease  the   situation as soon as possible. The tough positions that  have been taken by the parties concerned serve only to  escalate tensions, deepen divisions and decrease mutual  trust.  Therefore,  such  positions  are  not  helpful  to  the   security  of  all  parties.  The  parties  concerned  should   keep calm and exercise restraint in order to prevent the  situation on the Korean peninsula from worsening and  getting out of control. They should create the necessary  conditions for turning the situation around. Secondly,  it  is  necessary  to  act  in  accordance   with  the  provisions  and  spirit  of  the  Security  Council   resolutions relating to the  Democratic People’s Republic  of Korea and push for an appropriate settlement of the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. Since 2016, the  Council has unanimously adopted a series of resolutions  on   the   Democratic   People’s   Republic   of   Korea.    Those  resolutions  represent  the  common  will  of  the   international  community  and  constitute  international   obligations  that  must  be  observed  by  all  parties.  All   parties must comprehensively implement the resolutions  relating to the  Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in  their entirety; strengthen non-proliferation measures in  order to curb the nuclear and missile programmes of the   Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea;  and  actively   push for a peaceful settlement through diplomatic and  political  means.  At  the  same  time,  there  is  a  need  to   avoid negatively impacting the livelihoods of the people  of the  Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the  humanitarian assistance activities that are taking place  in  the  country.  Unilateral  sanctions  measures  without   the  authorization  of  the  Security  Council  undermine   the unity of the Council and hurt the legitimate rights  and interests of other countries. Therefore, such actions  should be abandoned. Thirdly, it is necessary for all sides to shoulder their  respective  responsibilities  and  fulfil  their  incumbent   obligations  in  earnest.  The  current  situation  on  the   Korean peninsula has not been caused by any individual  party  alone.  It  is  not  helpful  to  impose  responsibility   for resolving the problem on a single party. The parties  concerned  should  try  to  converge  instead  of  engaging   in mutual blaming. They should also not try to abdicate  their own responsibility and shift the blame onto others.  The United States has committed to not seeking regime  change, not pursuing the overthrow of the Government  of  the    Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea,  not   accelerating the reunification of the Korean peninsula  and  not  moving  its  troops  beyond  the  thirty-eighth   parallel. We hope that the United States will turn those  four commitments into concrete actions. Fourthly,  it  is  necessary  to  remain  committed  to   peacefully settling the situation and resuming dialogue  and  negotiations  as  soon  as  possible.  Security  is  at   the  core  of  the  nuclear  issue  of  the  Korean  peninsula.   As  such,  the  fundamental  solution  lies  in  addressing   the  security  concerns  of  all  parties,  including  the     Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, in a balanced  manner. There is no military option with respect to the  settlement of the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula.  Resorting  to  force  will  only  bring  about  disastrous   consequences   for   the   peninsula.   Sanctions   are   a    means,  not  an  end.  History  shows  that  dialogue  and   negotiations are a fundamental way to ease tensions and  advance the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.  The  parties  concerned  should  endeavour  to  turn  the   pressure of sanctions into the driving force behind the  resumption  of  dialogue  and  negotiations.  They  should   get  the  nuclear  issue  of  the  Korean  peninsula  back  on   the right track of peaceful settlement through dialogue  and negotiations at an early date. As  a  close  neighbour  of  the  Korean  peninsula,   China has persisted in promoting the denuclearization  of the peninsula, preserving peace and stability on the  peninsula  and  seeking  a  settlement  to  the  situation   through  dialogue  and  negotiations.  China  is  opposed   to conflicts and chaos on the Korean peninsula. China  has always supported and comprehensively and strictly  implemented  Security  Council  resolutions  relating  to   the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea.  By  doing   so,  China  has  made  greater  efforts  and  paid  a  higher   price  than  anyone  else.  It  is  irresponsible  to  doubt  or   challenge what China has done.  In  view  of  the  current  situation  on  the  peninsula,   China has put forward the dual suspension proposal that  would entail the suspension by the Democratic People’s  Republic  of  Korea  of  its  nuclear  and  missile  activities   along with the suspension by the United States and the  Republic of Korea of large-scale military exercises. We  have  proposed  the  dual-track  approach  of  promoting   parallel  progress  in  denuclearization  efforts  and  the   establishment of a peace mechanism on the peninsula.  The Russian Federation has also put forward the idea of  a phased approach to the settlement of the issues of the  Korean peninsula. On  the  basis  of  those  proposals,  China  and  the   Russian  Federation  issued  a  joint  statement  on  4  July   that  proposed  a  road  map  for  the  settlement  of  the   problems on the Korean peninsula. The joint proposal of  China and Russia is practical and feasible and is aimed  at  promoting  the  peaceful  settlement  of  the  nuclear   issue  of  the  Korean  peninsula  and  the  maintenance  of   peace and stability on the peninsula. As such, we hope  that the proposal will elicit responses and support from  the parties concerned. Due to historical reasons, the Korean peninsula is  still under the shadow of the Cold War. That is the root  cause of the protracted nature of, and lack of settlement  for,  the  nuclear  issue  on  the  Korean  peninsula. The  parties   concerned   must   reject   Cold   War   thinking    in   all   its   forms,   establish   a   concept   of   common,    comprehensive,  cooperative  and  sustainable  security,   and  seek  a  peaceful  settlement  to  the  Korean  nuclear   issue  through  political  and  diplomatic  means,  so  as   to  realize,  at  an  early  date,  the  denuclearization  of   the  Korean  peninsula  and  the  long-term  security  and   tranquillity  of  North-East  Asia  for  the  benefit  of  the   people of the countries in the region. China  stands  ready  to  work  together  with  the   parties  concerned  and  the  international  community  to   continue to play a positive and constructive role for the  realization of this goal.",Mr. Wu Haitao,Non-proliferation/Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,8137,2017-12-15
"Resolution   2397   (2017),   adopted   by   the   Security    Council  today,  reflects  the  unanimous  position  of  the   international community in opposing the development  of  nuclear  and  ballistic  missile  capabilities  by  the   Democratic    People’s    Republic    of    Korea    and    in     maintaining the international nuclear non-proliferation  regime.    China    urges    the    Democratic    People’s     Republic  of  Korea  to  seriously  heed  the  demands  of   the  international  community,  abide  by  and  implement   the   Security   Council   resolutions   and   refrain   from    conducting any further nuclear and missile tests. At  the  same  time,  the  resolution  underscores  that   the  nuclear  issue  on  the  Korean  peninsula  need  to  be   resolved peacefully by political and diplomatic means.  It  also  stipulates  that  the  measures  it  contains  are   not  intended  to  have  an  adverse  impact  on  economic   activities  and  cooperation,  food  aid  or  humanitarian   assistance.   China   hopes   that   all   the   parties   will    implement the resolution fully and comprehensively. At  present,  the  situation  on  the  Korean  peninsula   is   one   of   constant   tension.   While   the   Democratic    People’s  Republic  of  Korea  has  continued  to  conduct   nuclear  tests  and  missile  launches,  in  defiance  of  the   universal  opposition  by  the  international  community,   the  other  parties  concerned  have  continued  to  expand   military  exercises  and  scale  up  their  shows  of  force.   The  escalation  of  tension  on  the  Korean  peninsula,   which has reached the point of risking spiralling out of  control, is not in the interests of any party. The nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula has lasted  for more than two decades. Reviewing the evolution of  the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula, We can see  that  dialogue  and  negotiations  have  led  to  progress  in   the  denuclearization  of  the  Korean  peninsula  and  the   improvement of relations among the parties concerned,  while tough posturing and confrontation have impeded  denuclearization and resulted in deteriorating relations  among  the  parties  concerned.  It  is  imperative  to  learn   from past good practices and mistakes. The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula should  be solved peacefully and comprehensively. Security is at  the heart of the nuclear issue on the peninsula while the  fundamental  solution  rests  on  addressing  the  security   concerns   of   all   parties,   including   the   Democratic    People’s   Republic   of   Korea.   There   is   no   military    option  for  settling  the  nuclear  issue  on  the  peninsula.   Resorting to force will only lead to disaster. Sanctions  are  only  a  means  to  an  end.  One  should  not  expect  to   settle the issue through unilateral sanctions or pressure.  History  has  proven  that  dialogue  and  negotiations  are   the  fundamental  way  in  which  to  de-escalate  tension   and promote denuclearization on the peninsula. To that end, it is imperative to end immediately all  rhetoric  and  action  that  are  detrimental  to  achieving   denuclearization, peace and stability on the peninsula.  In order to de-escalate the situation as soon as possible,  it is important to strictly follow the letter and spirit of  the relevant Security Council resolutions to arrive at an  acceptable settlement. All parties should shoulder their  respective responsibilities and effectively assume their  obligations.  It  is  imperative  to  follow  the  overarching   direction  leading  towards  a  peaceful  settlement  and   resume dialogue and negotiations at an early date. Any  unilateral sanctions imposed outside the purview of the  Security Council would only undermine the Council’s  unity and jeopardize the legitimate rights and interests  of other countries, and should therefore be rejected. China  has  always  advocated  for  denuclearization   of  the  peninsula,  its  peace  and  stability,  and  finding   a  solution  through  dialogue  and  consultations.  We  are   opposed to turmoil and war on the peninsula. China has  made  enormous  efforts  to  reach  settlements  through   dialogue and negotiations, and has paid a higher price  than  all  other  parties  in  implementing  the  relevant   Security Council resolutions. In  view  of  the  situation  on  the  peninsula,  China   has  proposed  the  suspension-for-suspension  initiative,   which  would  entail  the  suspension  by  the  Democratic   People’s  Republic  of  Korea  of  its  nuclear  and  missile   activities along with the suspension by the United States  and Republic of Korea of large-scale military exercises.  We  have  also  proposed  the  dual-track  approach  of   promoting    parallel    progress    in    denuclearization     efforts  and  the  establishment  of  a  peace  mechanism   on  the  peninsula.  Russia  has  also  put  forward  the   idea  of  a  phased  approach  for  that  purpose.  Based  on   those  proposals,  China  and  Russia  have  issued  a  joint   statement  setting  out  a  road  map  for  resolving  the   issue. The joint proposal of China and Russia is aimed  at peacefully settling the issue and the maintenance of  peace  and  stability  on  the  peninsula.  Accordingly,  we   hope that the proposal will elicit responses and support  from the concerned parties. If the situation on the peninsula is allowed to remain  stuck in the current vicious cycle, the road will continue  to narrow. A peaceful settlement will be reached only  when the parties meet each other halfway, in dialogue  and consultations. The parties concerned should fulfil  their  historical  responsibilities  and  relaunch  dialogue   and negotiations as soon as possible so as to settle the  issue appropriately and at an early date. China is ready  to  join  with  the  international  community,  persuade   the  parties  to  return  to  the  proper  track  of  peaceful   settlement, and play a positive and constructive role in  achieving denuclearization, lasting peace and stability  on the peninsula.",Mr. Wu Haitao,Non-proliferation/Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,8151,2017-12-22
