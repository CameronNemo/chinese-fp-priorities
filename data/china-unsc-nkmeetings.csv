"China is  opposed to the Security Council discussing the situation  of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of  Korea. The Charter of the United Nations stipulates in  no  uncertain  terms  that  the  primary  responsibility  of   the Security Council is the maintenance of international  peace  and  security.  The  Security  Council  is  not  a   forum  for  discussing  human  rights  issues,  still  less   for the politicization of such issues. Given the current  context,  in  which  international  peace  and  security  are   facing a plethora of dire challenges, the Council should  scrupulously  honour  its  responsibility  and  focus  on   issues related to international peace and security with  undivided attention. China consistently stands for the decnuclearization  of  the  Korean  peninsula  and  insists  that  it  be  kept   peaceful   and   stable   and   that   solutions   be   sought    through dialogue and consultation. We shall not allow  the peninsula to be torn asunder or riven with turmoil  in  any  circumstances.  Our  position  is  in  line  with  the   common   interests   of   the   international   community    and  all  parties,  and  should  be  the  common  goal  of   everyone’s efforts. The  discussion  of  the  situation  of  human  rights   in   the   Democratic   People’s   Republic   of   Korea   is    contrary and detrimental to that goal and of no benefit  whatsoever.  The  current  situation  in  the  peninsula  is   complex, sensitive and dire. China hopes that Council  members and other parties concerned will focus on the  big picture, meet each other half way, do more to ease  tensions  on  the  peninsula,  and  avoid  any  rhetoric  or   action that could provoke or escalate tensions. The  top  priority  for  the  moment  is  to  resume   dialogue and negotiations among the parties as soon as  possible, reopen the Six-Party Talks, jointly safeguard  the  process  of  denuclearizing  the  peninsula  and  make   a  genuine  effort  to  ensure  stability  and  peace  on  the   peninsula. China will push for dialogue and consultation  so  as  to  resolve  the  relevant  issues  on  the  peninsula   within  the  framework  of  the  Six-Party  Talks,  in  order   to  make  a  positive  and  constructive  contribution  to   stability and peace on the peninsula at an early date.","Mr. Liu Jieyi","09/12/2016","The situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea",7830,"2016-12-09"
"On 9  September,  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of   Korea conducted yet another nuclear test, in defiance of  the universal objections of the international community.  The  Government  of  China  is  firmly  opposed  to  such   acts.  The  Council’s  adoption  today  of  resolution  2321   (2016)  ref lects  the  international  community’s  united   position  against  the  development  of  nuclear  missile   programmes   by   the   Democratic   People’s   Republic    of  Korea  and  in  support  of  the  international  nuclear   non-proliferation  regime.  The  resolution  reaffirms  the   importance of safeguarding peace and stability on the  Korean  peninsula  and  in  North-East  Asia,  commits   to  seeking  a  solution  to  the  issue  through  peaceful,   diplomatic and political means, supports the resumption  of  the  Six-Party  Talks  and  the  commitments  made  in   the  joint  statement  of  19  September,  and  emphasizes   the importance of easing tensions on the peninsula for  all parties concerned. As the resolution notes, the sanctions measures are  not  aimed  at  worsening  the  humanitarian  situation  in   the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, harming its  people’s livelihoods or affecting normal economic and  trade  activities.  China  urges  the  parties  concerned  to   work to effectively implement the resolution’s relevant  provisions in their entirety. Since the beginning of the  year,  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea  has   conducted  two  nuclear  tests  and  multiple  ballistic- missile    launches.    However,    certain    parties    have     continued  to  strengthen  their  military  deployments,   increase  their  military  presence  and  scale  up  military   exercises,   and   the   confrontation   on   the   peninsula    has  intensified  into  a  vicious  circle  as  a  result.  That   situation must change as soon as possible. As a near neighbour of the Korean peninsula, China  has consistently insisted that it should be denuclearized  and  its  peace  and  stability  upheld.  We  have  always   called  for  the  issue  to  be  resolved  through  dialogue   and  consultations  and  have  fought  against  turmoil   and conflict. We are opposed to the deployment of the  Terminal  High  Altitude  Area  Defense  anti-ballistic   missile   system   on   the   peninsula,   as   it   seriously    undermines the strategic security interests of China and  other countries of the region and disturbs the regional  strategic  balance.  It  is  neither  conducive  to  achieving   the  goal  of  denuclearizing  the  Korean  peninsula  nor   helpful to the maintenance of peace and stability there. China urges the parties concerned to stop forthwith  the  related  deployment  process.  The  current  situation   on the Korean peninsula is sensitive, complex and dire.  All parties must look at the big picture, meet each other  halfway  and  avoid  any  rhetoric  or  action  that  might   exacerbate  tension.  The  top  priority  for  the  parties   concerned  is  to  resume  dialogue  and  negotiations  and   relaunch  the  Six-Party  Talks  as  soon  as  possible  in   order  to  work  together  in  a  genuine  effort  to  advance   the  denuclearization  process  and  achieve  peace  and   stability on the Korean peninsula. China urges the parties concerned to push forward  in parallel the negotiations on denuclearization, on one  hand,  and  the  replacement  of  armistice  with  a  peace   treaty,  on  the  other.  China  will  persist  in  advancing   dialogue  and  consultations  with  a  view  to  solving  the   problems  related  to  the  Korean  peninsula  within  the   framework  of  the  Six-Party  Talks,  thereby  playing  a   positive  and  constructive  role  in  achieving  enduring   peace and stability on the Korean peninsula at an early  date.","Mr. Liu Jieyi","30/11/2016","Non-proliferation/Democratic People’s Republic of Korea",7821,"2016-11-30"
"On   6 January, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, in  defiance of the universal opposition of the international  community,  once  again  conducted  a  nuclear  test,  and   on  7  February  used  ballistic  technology  to  launch  a   satellite in a series of violations of the relevant Security  Council  resolutions.  China  has  expressed  its  explicit   opposition to those actions. China  has  always  insisted  on  the  denuclearization   of  the  Korean  peninsula,  insisted  on  the  maintenance   of  peace  and  stability  on  the  peninsula  and  insisted   on     resolving     problems     through     dialogue     and      consultations.  Resolution  2270  (2016),  adopted  by  the   Council  today,  embodies  the  principles  inherent  in   those  three  “insists”.  The  resolution  demonstrates  the   international   community’s   seriousness   in   opposing    the  further  development  of  the  nuclear  and  missile   capacity of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  and  safeguarding  the  international  non-proliferation   regime  and  reaffirms  the  commitment  to  seeking  a   solution  to  the  nuclear  issue  on  the  Korean  peninsula   through  dialogue  and  consultations  and  to  supporting   the  resumption  of  the  Six-Party  Talks  and  the  Joint   Statement  of  19  September  2005,  thus  facilitating  the   effort to seek a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on  the Korean peninsula. China   has   always   advocated   for   the   peaceful    settlement   of   international   disputes   and   hot-spot    issues  through  political  and  diplomatic  means  such  as   dialogue and negotiations. Sanctions are not an end in  themselves,  and  Security  Council  resolutions  cannot   fundamentally resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula. Today’s resolution should be a new starting  point,  paving  the  way  for  a  political  settlement  of  the   nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. History has demonstrated repeatedly that dialogue  and negotiations represent the only right way to address  the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula if we are to  achieve  an  early  improvement  of  the  situation  on  the   ground  and  explore  viable  ways  to  resolve  the  matter.   China  urges  the  parties  concerned  to  push  forward  in   parallel  the  negotiations  to  advance  denuclearization   and  replace  the  peace  armistice  mechanism  with  a   peace mechanism. While keeping the general direction  of  denuclearization,  this  approach  accommodates  in  a   balanced way the main concerns of the parties involved,  helps find a way towards the resumption of talks and is  practicable.  China  is  willing  to  work  with  the  parties   concerned to explore in depth specific steps to put this  idea into practice and hopes that all parties concerned  will work together to this end. As a close neighbour to the Korean peninsula and a  State that bears an important responsibility for stability  there, China has always insisted on the overall goal of  denuclearization  of  the  peninsula,  opposed  conflicts   and  chaos  in  that  area  and  worked  to  safeguard  the   legitimate security interests of itself and other countries  of the region. At this moment, all the parties concerned  should  avoid  actions  that  will  further  aggravate  the   tensions on the ground. China opposes the deployment  of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile  system on the Korean peninsula because such an action  harms  the  strategic  security  interests  of  China  and   other  countries  of  the  region,  goes  against  the  goal   of  maintaining  peace,  security  and  stability  of  the   peninsula  and  will  seriously  undermine  the  efforts  of   the international community to find a political solution  to the question of the Korean peninsula. Currently, the situation on the Korean peninsula is  highly  complex  and  sensitive,  which  makes  it  all  the   more necessary for us to keep calm and use diplomatic  wisdom.  China  hopes  that  the  parties  concerned  will   meet China half way, always keeping in mind the overall  need to maintain the peace and stability of the Korean  peninsula   and   North-East   Asia,   make   determined    efforts  to  the  dispel  the  dark  cloud  of  war,  pool  our   wisdom   and   actively   seek   common   understanding    and   work   together   for   the   denuclearization   of   the    Korean   peninsula.   China   will   continue   to   take   a    responsible approach to enhancing communication and  coordination  with  the  parties  concerned  and  play  an   active and constructive role for an early realization of  lasting stability and peace on the Korean peninsula.","Mr. Liu Jieyi","02/03/2016","Non-proliferation/Democratic People’s Republic of Korea",7638,"2016-03-02"
"China is  always  opposed  to  intervention  by  the  Council  on   issues  concerning  the  human  rights  situation  in  any   country.  The  Charter  of  the  United  Nations  clearly   lays  out  the  functions  and  division  of  labour  among   the  major  organs  of  the  United  Nations,  which  should   discharge  their  respective  responsibilities  and  refrain   from encroaching on the functions of others.  As   bearer   of   the   primary   responsibility   for    maintaining   international   peace   and   security,   the    Council  should  devote  itself  to  addressing  threats  to   international  peace  and  security.  It  is  not  the  venue   for  addressing  issues  of  human  rights,  and  the  human   rights  situation  in  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic   of  Korea  does  not  constitute  a  threat  to  international   peace  and  security.  China  is  against  allowing  the   Council  to  deliberate  on  the  human  rights  situation  in   the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. We request  that a vote be held on the provisional agenda of today’s  meeting.","Mr. Wang Min ","10/12/2015","The situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea",7575,"2015-12-10"
"China   is  opposed  to  exploiting  the  existence  of  large-scale   violations  of  human  rights  in  the  Democratic  People’s   Republic  of  Korea  as  a  reason  to  include  the  situation   in  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea  in  the   agenda  of  the  Security  Council.  The  Charter  of  the   United  Nations  stipulates  explicitly  that  the  primary   responsibility  of  the  Security  Council  is  to  maintain   international  peace  and  security.  The  United  Nations   organs   each   have   their   own   respective   functions    and  mandates.  The  Security  Council  is  not  a  forum   designed  for  involvement  in  human  rights  issues,  and   still  less  should  human  rights  issues  be  politicized.   Currently,  international  peace  and  security  are  faced   with   numerous   daunting   challenges.   The   Security    Council should strictly abide by its responsibilities and  concentrate  on  addressing  issues  that  really  concern   international peace and security. The  situation  on  the  Korean  peninsula  remains   complex   and   sensitive.   Upholding   the   goal   of   the    denuclearization  of  the  peninsula,  maintaining  peace   and stability on the peninsula and insisting on dialogue  and  consultations  as  a  way  to  resolve  issues  is  in  the   common  interests  of  all  parties  concerned  and  should   be the direction towards which all parties should work  together.   The   Security   Council   should   work   more    to  facilitate  dialogue  and  ease  tensions  and  refrain   from  doing  anything  that  might  cause  an  escalation   of  tensions.  The  Security  Council’s  inclusion  of  the   Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea  situation  on   its  agenda  in  order  to  involve  itself  of  the  situation  of   human  rights  in  that  country  will  work  against  those   goals and can only do harm rather than good.","Mr. Liu Jieyi","23/12/2014","The situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea",7353,"2014-12-23"
"The  Security  Council  has  just  adopted  resolution  1874   (2009) on the nuclear test conducted by the Democratic  People’s    Republic    of    Korea.    On    25    May,    the     Democratic   People’s   Republic   of   Korea   conducted    another   nuclear   test   in   disregard   of   the   common    objection  of  the  international  community.  The  Chinese   Ministry   for   Foreign   Affairs   issued   a   statement    expressing its firm opposition.  We    strongly    urge    the    Democratic    People’s     Republic   of   Korea   to   honour   its   commitment   to    denuclearization,  cease  all  actions  that  may  exacerbate   the situation and return to th e Six-Party Talks. China is  committed, as always, to sa feguarding the international  nuclear    non-proliferation    regime,    promoting    the     denuclearization    of    the    Korean    peninsula    and     maintaining peace and stability there and in North-East  Asia.  In     conducting     another     nuclear     test,     the      Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea  violated  the   relevant  resolutions  of  the  Security  Council,  impaired   the   effectiveness   of   the    international   nuclear   non- proliferation  regime  and  af fected  regional  peace  and   stability.   We   support   an   appropriate   and   balanced    reaction  of  the  Security  Council  to  the  Democratic   People’s Republic of Korea’s nuclear test.  The  provisions  of  resolution  1874  (2009)  are  in   line  with  Article  41  of  Ch apter  VII  of  the  United   Nations  Charter.  The  resolution  not  only  demonstrates   the  international  community’s  firm  opposition  to  the   Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea’s  nuclear  test,   but  also  sends  a  positive  signal  to  that  country.  It   reflects  the  firm  determinati on  of  the  Security  Council   to  resolve  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea   nuclear    issue    peacefully    through    dialogue    and     negotiation.  In  that  context,  the  Chinese  delegation   voted in favour of resolution 1874 (2009).  It   should   be   stressed   that   the   sovereignty,    territorial  integrity  and  le gitimate  security  concerns   and  development  interests  of  the  Democratic  People’s   Republic  of  Korea  must  be  respected.  Once  it  returns   to   the   Treaty   on   the   Non-Proliferation   of   Nuclear    Weapons,  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea,   as  a  State  party,  will  enjoy  the  right  to  enjoy  the   peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The Security Council’s  actions   should   not   adversely   impact   the   economic    viability   or   the   development   of   the   Democratic    People’s   Republic   of   Korea   or   the   delivery   of    humanitarian assistance to the country.  As    indicated    in    the    relevant    paragraph    of     resolution  1874  (2009),  if  the  Democratic  People’s   Republic    of    Korea    complie s    with    the    relevant     provisions  of  the  resolution,  the  Security  Council  will   review the appropriateness of suspending or lifting the  measures it has imposed.  I  wish  to  stress  that  the  issue  of  cargo  inspection   is   complex   and   sensitive.   Countries   need   to   act    prudently  and  in  strict  accordance  with  domestic  and   international  law  and  on  the  condition  of  reasonable   grounds  and  sufficient  evidence.  All  parties  should   refrain  from  any  word  or  deed  that  could  exacerbate   the  conflict.  Under  no  circumstances  should  force  be   used or threatened.  The    Chinese    Government    has    consistently     advocated a peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue on  the  Korean  peninsula  through  political  and  diplomatic   means. China has made tremendous efforts to that end.  We initiated the Six-Party Talks and pushed for a joint  statement by the six parties in September 2005. Thanks  to  the  concerted  efforts  of   all  parties,  the  Six-Party   Talks  made  some  initial  progr ess.  At  present,  despite   the  second  nuclear  test  undertaken  by  the  Democratic   People’s  Republic  of  Korea  —  which  represents  a   negative  development  —  we  remain  of  the  view  that   Security Council actions are not all about sanctions and  that political and diplomatic means are the only way to  resolve       the       relevant       issues,       achieve       the        denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and safeguard  peace and stability in North-East Asia.  In    the    current    circumstances,    the    parties     concerned  should  remain  calm,  exercise  restraint  and   refrain  from  actions  that  may  aggravate  the  situation.   Such  behaviour  would  serve  the  common  interests  of   all  parties.  China  will  conti nue  to  act  in  a  responsible   and  constructive  manner  to  strengthen  contacts  among   the  parties  concerned,  address  the  issue  appropriately,   work  for  an  early  resumption  of  the  Six-Party  Talks   and     play     an     active     role     in     achieving     the      denuclearization    of    the    Korean    peninsula    and     maintaining peace and stability there and in North-East  Asia.","Mr. Zhang Yesui","12/06/2009","Non-proliferation/Democratic People’s Republic of Korea",6141,"2009-06-12"
"The  Security  Council  has  just  adopted  a  resolution  on   the  nuclear  test  by  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic   of Korea.  On  9  October  2006,  the  Democratic  People’s   Republic  of  Korea  flagrantly  conducted  a  nuclear  test   in    disregard    of    the    common    opposition    of    the     international   community.   This   is   not   conducive   to    peace and stability in North-East Asia. The Ministry of  Foreign  Affairs  of  China  issued  a  statement  on  the   same  day  and  expressed  firm  opposition  to  this  act.   Proceeding from the overall interests of bringing about  denuclearization    of    the    Korean    peninsula    and     maintaining    peace    and    stability    on    the    Korean     peninsula  and  in  North-East  Asia,  China  supports  the   Security   Council   in   making   firm   and   appropriate    response.  We  believe  that  the  action  of  the  Security   Council  should  both  indicate  the  firm  position  of  the   international   community   and   help   create   enabling    conditions   for   the   final   peaceful   solution   to   the    Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea  nuclear  issue   through  dialogue.  As  the  resolution  basically  reflects   the aforementioned spirit, the Chinese delegation voted  in favour of it.  China  would  like  to  reiterate  here  that  sanctions   in  themselves  are  not  the  end.  As  stipulated  by  the   relevant provisions of the resolution, if the Democratic  People’s Republic of Korea complies with the relevant  requests  of  the  resolution,  the  Security  Council  will   suspend   or   lift   sanctions    against   the   Democratic    People’s Republic of Korea.   At the same time, we wish to point out that China  does not approve of the practice of inspecting cargo to  and  from  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea.   We   therefore   have   reservations   about   the   relevant    provisions  of  the  resolution.  China  strongly  urges  the   countries concerned to adopt a prudent and responsible  attitude  in  this  regard  and  to  refrain  from  taking  any   provocative steps that may intensify the tension.  The   Chinese   Government   has   all   along   been    committed  to  bringing  about   the  denuclearization  of   the   Korean   peninsula   and   maintaining   peace   and    stability  on  the  Korean  peninsula  and  in  North-East   Asia.  We  have  always  advocated  seeking  a  peaceful   solution  to  the  nuclear  issue  on  the  Korean  peninsula   through  diplomatic  means.  China  has  made  enormous   and unremitting efforts to that end. It initiated the Six- Party  Talks  and  pushed  parties  concerned  to  reach  the   Joint   Statement   of   September   2005.   Although   the    negative   development   of   the   Democratic   People’s    Republic   of   Korea   nuclear   test   has   emerged,   our    policies  as  just  outlined  re main  unchanged.  We  still   believe that the Six-Party Talks are the realistic way to  handle  the  relevant  issues.  We  also  firmly  oppose  the   use  of  force.  China  has  noted  with  satisfaction  that  in   condemning   the   nuclear   test   of   the   Democratic    People’s Republic of Korea, the parties concerned have  all  indicated  the  importance  of  adhering  to  diplomatic   efforts.           China     believes     that     under     the     current      circumstances  we  should  unswervingly  stick  to  the   objective   of   the   denuclearization   of   the   Korean    peninsula,  oppose  nuclear  proliferation,  adhere  to  the   general   direction   of   resolving   the   issue   through    peaceful  dialogue  and  negotiation,  avoid  any  acts  that   may  cause  the  tension  to  escalate  and  the  situation  to   get  out  of  control,  and  main tain  peace  and  stability  on   the Korean peninsula and in North-East Asia. This is in  the  common  interests  of  all  the  parties  concerned.  All   the parties should make vigorous and positive efforts to  this  end.  China  is  ready  and  willing  to  strengthen   consultations   and   coordination   with   other   parties    concerned  so  as  to  respond  in  a  cool-headed  manner,   push forward the six-party process and continue to play  a     constructive     role     in     bringing     about     the      denuclearization    of    the    Korean    peninsula    and  maintaining    peace    and    stability    on    the    Korean     peninsula and in North-East Asia","Mr. Wang Guangya","14/10/2006","Non-proliferation/Democratic People’s Republic of Korea",5551,"2006-10-14"
"The  Chinese  delegation  welcomes  the  draft  resolution   on   the   launching   of   missiles   by   the   Democratic    People’s  Republic  of  Korea,  unanimously  adopted  by   the Security Council earlier.   On   5   July   2006   local   time,   the   Democratic    People’s  Republic  of  Korea  launched  a  number  of   missiles  without  adequate  advance  notification,  which   caused     extensive     concern     in     the     international      community. Many countries have expressed their grave  concern  at  that  negative  development.  They  are  afraid   that   it   will   have   a   negative   impact   on   peace   and    stability  in  North-East  Asia,  especially  on  the  Korean   peninsula.  As  a  close  neighbour  of  the  Democratic  People’s   Republic  of  Korea,  China  is  gravely  concerned  about   the newly emerged complicating factors on the Korean  peninsula.   China   has   always   been   committed   to    maintaining    peace    and    stability    on    the    Korean     peninsula  and  has  insisted  on  resolving  the  relevant   issues  through  peaceful  dialogue  and  negotiations.  We   oppose  any  acts  leading  to  tension  on  the  Korean   peninsula.  We  hope  that  all  the  parties  concerned  will   keep  in  mind  the  overall  interests  and  make  a  greater   contribution   to   peace   and   stability   on   the   Korean    peninsula.  The  Chinese  side  is  ready  to  make  joint   efforts  with  all  the  parties  concerned  to  overcome   difficulties,  create  the  right  conditions,  promote  the   six-party  talks  and  jointly   maintain  peace  and  stability   on the Korean peninsula and in North-East Asia.  Ever  since  discussions  started  in  the  Security   Council on the launching of missiles by the Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea,  China  has  acted  in  a   persistent  manner  to  achieve  two  major  objectives,   namely,  to  maintain  peace   and  stability  on  the  Korean   peninsula  and  to  keep  the  Security  Council  united.  We   have  consistently  advocated  that  the  Council  respond   in  an  appropriate  manner  as  soon  as  possible,  send  a   unified    message    to    the    international    community,     reactivate  a  new  round  of  diplomatic  efforts  and  bring   about the early resumption of the six-party talks.  China  has  adopted  a  resp onsible  attitude  and  is   firmly  opposed  to  forcing  through  a  vote  on  a  draft   resolution that is not conducive to unity and that would  further  complicate  and  aggravate  the  situation,  cause   grave  consequenc es  for  peace  and  stability  on  the   Korean  peninsula  and  create  enormous  obstacles  for   the   six-party   talks   and   other   important   diplomatic    endeavours.  At  the  same  time,  China  and  Russia  put  forward   elements   for   a   draft   presidential   statement   and,    subsequently,    for    a    draft    resolution.    We    made     constructive  and  vigorous  efforts  to  seek  consensus  on   this issue among Security Council members.  Under  the  current  circumstances,  China  urges  all   the  parties  concerned  to  exercise  restraint.  We  are   opposed  to  any  acts  leading  to  further  tension  on  the   Korean peninsula. We hope that the resolution that has  just been adopted will help  all the parties concerned to  act   in   a   calm   manner   and   to   continue   diplomatic    endeavours   aimed   at   the   denuclearization   of   the    Korean  peninsula  and  the  normalization  of  relations   between  the  countries  concerned.  Maintaining  peace   and stability on the Korean peninsula is in the common  interests of the international community and the North- East  Asian  countries  and  is  the  fundamental  starting   point  for  China  in  handling  Korean  peninsula  affairs.   China  will  continue  to  make  steadfast  efforts  to  that   end. ","Mr. Wang Guangya","15/07/2006","Democratic People's Republic of Korea",5490,"2006-07-15"
