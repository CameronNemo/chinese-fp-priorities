The situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea
10/12/2015

Mr. Wang Min 

China is  always  opposed  to  intervention  by  the  Council  on  
issues  concerning  the  human  rights  situation  in  any  
country.  The  Charter  of  the  United  Nations  clearly  
lays  out  the  functions  and  division  of  labour  among  
the  major  organs  of  the  United  Nations,  which  should  
discharge  their  respective  responsibilities  and  refrain  
from encroaching on the functions of others. 
As   bearer   of   the   primary   responsibility   for   
maintaining   international   peace   and   security,   the   
Council  should  devote  itself  to  addressing  threats  to  
international  peace  and  security.  It  is  not  the  venue  
for  addressing  issues  of  human  rights,  and  the  human  
rights  situation  in  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  
of  Korea  does  not  constitute  a  threat  to  international  
peace  and  security.  China  is  against  allowing  the  
Council  to  deliberate  on  the  human  rights  situation  in  
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. We request 
that a vote be held on the provisional agenda of today’s 
meeting.
