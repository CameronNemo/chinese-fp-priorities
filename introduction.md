​	In this paper I will explore how China's perceptions and foreign policy priorities change in response to different degrees and types of provocation on the Korean peninsula. The Korean peninsula has been host to significant and frequent military exercises, missile tests, and nuclear tests. China has been given a unique opportunity to demonstrate regional leadership, and a challenge to protect its own security. Historically, China has remained opaque about its foreign policy. This behavior is best explained by [keeping a low profile]. By revealing how China has balanced its goals in the presence of varying provocation, this paper will identify stakes and friction points shared with other regional actors and help gauge China's appetite for pursuing regional leadership in its foreign policy.
