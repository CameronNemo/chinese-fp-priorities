This paper seeks to answer two questions surrounding Chinese perceptions of nuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The first question asks what components China considers most important to the issue. This question aims to provide a descriptive analysis of the components of denuclearization that China considers relevant, such as complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization (CVID) of DPRK capabilities or, alternatively, elimination of or cuts to the Republic of Korea's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system. The next question seeks to answer how important China considers denuclearization relative to its other foreign policy priorities.
