# Title

should be brief, specific and informative, indicating the nature and scope of your report.

## Abstract

One-paragraph summary of the entire study – typically no more than 250 words in length and
covers the scope and purpose of your paper; an overview of methodology; a summary of the
main findings or results; principal conclusions or significance of the findings

## Introduction (1-3 pages)

Describes the <u>topic under investigation</u> and provides <u>motivation for the paper</u>. This may be based on some <u>real world events and significance</u>, based on some <u>synthesis of prior research</u>, or both. This is typically followed by a quick <u>summary of what the paper does</u>, and what <u>the contribution of the paper</u> is.

Typical components to consider:

1. ~~What is the research question and the broader topic?~~
2. ~~Why are you interested in this topic?~~
3. ~~Why should others care about this topic?~~
4. Outline of the specific questions and hypothesis
5. Summary of findings
6. Summary of contributions

## Literature Review and Theory (3-6 pages)

A literature review is a critical survey of recent relevant research in a particular field. Its
purpose is both to offer the reader an overview of the current state of research and to situate
your paper within that research. The review is not simply a summary of all you have read.
Rather, it must develop an argument or a point of view that supports your chosen methodology
and research questions.

A very crude hypothetical example: “Researchers A, B, and C have argued that globalization will
create a race to the bottom. D and E, on the other hand, argued that it wll rather increase labor
standard because […]. These two are very different and cannot be easily reconciled. I argue that
depending on the nature of the main commodity of exports, countries either end up in the
former or the later case.” Here, you use the lit review to identify a gap in the literature, and
then start developing your own theory.

In other cases, there may not be any clear debate in the literature. Rather, you have be
shedding light on something that has been discussed a little bit, but not really given enough
attention. Depending on your question, you need to: compare and contrast different
approaches; evaluate research methods; highlight gaps in research; look for inconsistencies and
ethical issues; assess the form, structure and clarity of the written results and constantly
question your sources and their relationship to your study. Conclude your literature review by 
linking key findings to your study and highlighting what you are doing differently or are adding
to the broader literature. This will either lead to more extensive details about your own theory,
or at least a set of testable hypotheses.

## Research Design (2-6 pages)

The purpose of this section is to detail how you conducted your research to test the hypotheses
presented at the end of the previous section. You will need to provide details about at least the
following (not an exhaustive list):
1. What is the unit of analysis?
2. What is the scope of the units (e.g. # of countries, years, speeches, projects, etc)
3. What is the key dependent variable?
4. What is the key independent variable?
5. What are the control variables?
6. What is the general methodology applied?

## Results/Discussion (2-4 pages)

This is a section which describes the data that was collected and the results of any statistical
tests that were performed. This section of your paper is where you interpret your results and
explain their significance within the context of other research. Consider the adequacy of your
sampling techniques; the scope and longevity of your study; any problems with data collection
or analysis and any assumptions on which your study was based. This is the place to discuss any
disappointing results; the problems of making meaningful conclusions with limited samples; or
the difficulty of conducting the research (e.g. limitations in data availability).

## Conclusion (1-3 pages)

The last section where you should discuss the significance of your findings. To what extent and
in what ways are your findings useful or conclusive? Is further research required? If so, based
on your research experience, what suggestions could you make about improvements to the
scope or methodology of future studies? Also, consider the practical implications of your results
and any recommendations you could make.
